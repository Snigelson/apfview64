Commodore 64 APF file viewer.

This is a viewer for the Aperture Picture Format and Menu Format created by
Valve for the [Portal ARG](http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Portal_ARG). It
works with ALL TWO of the official images. It even loads the IBM CGA charset
(which, incidentally, is the same format as the C64 charset) and does simple
color translation, so that it looks as much as possible like the original
version.

This is one of my first real efforts at Commodore 64 programming, so bear
with me. Any help and pointers are very appreciated.

I might put up the file specifications later. It is a messed up format.

Requirements
============

DASM and c1541 (available with Vice).

Other work
==========

I want to make some kind of APF editor, maybe as a GIMP plugin, but I haven't
got the time. Sadface.
